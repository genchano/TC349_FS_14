        <h2>History and Tradition</h2>
        <p>Psi U has without a doubt the best chapter house at Michigan State University. The class of the Italian-American style reflects the brothers in the house. Psi Upsilon has been on campus since 1943. We are also one of the oldest national fraternities. Our chapter house is the best place to live during your time at MSU. We have 20 bedrooms competitively priced to alternative housing options. WiFi, satellite TV and telephone service is available in every room. Our full time cook prepares meals that are infinitely better than dorm food. The house was constructed in 1926. It is well maintained and is situated on the largest residential lot in East Lansing. We are located in a historical district just a few short blocks from campus.</p>
